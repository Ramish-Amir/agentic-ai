      "  - Carrier capacity and cost data\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Risk Assessment & Forecasting:**\n",
      "  - Use predictive analytics and probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks or deep learning-based time series forecasting) to identify likely disruptions ahead of time\n",
      "  - Quantify potential impact on shipments (delays, cost increases, stockouts)\n",
      "  - Prioritize risks by severity and urgency\n",
